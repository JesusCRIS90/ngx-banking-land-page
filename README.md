# 💰 Bank Landing Page - Angular Version
Welcome to my **Bank Landing Page**, a modern and responsive website built with **Angular**! 🚀  

## ✨ About the Project
This project is a **port of a previous React version**, now fully rebuilt using Angular.  

Beyond being just a landing page, this project has served as a testing ground for several experiments:  
* 🔄 **Framework Porting**: Originally made with React, now completely reimplemented with Angular.  
* 📦 **Custom Libraries (@beexy)**: A way to test my own libraries in more realistic, production-like scenarios. *(More news soon!)*  
* ⚙️ **Automation & Deployment**: Includes an experimental **bash script (deploy.sh)** to automate the deployment process toward github-pages.  

## 🚀 Features
* ✅ Sleek and responsive design  
* ✅ Interactive UI with smooth animations  
* ✅ Mobile-friendly layout  
* ✅ Modern banking-themed visuals
